# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Airline Tweets

## üìå Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on airline-related tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves data cleaning, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and training a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets into three sentiment categories :- POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, and NEGATIVE. The project includes visualizations to interpret the model's performance and identify the most influential words for each sentiment class.
